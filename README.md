# Payir Patient Management

**Deprecation Notice**

Google Calendar discontinued SMS notifications as of 27 June, 2015. As a result, this app may still be used to maintain patient records, but it can no longer be used to send follow-up reminders to health workers via SMS.

A patient management system for small organisations/community health centres that supports storing patient information and visit history, and reminders to follow up on patients after a few days, delivered by SMS to a team of health workers using Google Calendar API.

## Installation

### Release Builds

Coming soon

### Development

Download this repo and set up dependencies using `npm` and `bower`

```
npm install
bower install
```

This app uses nw (formerly known as node-webkit). You can install it using
```
npm install -g nw
```

Run the app using
```
nw /path/to/app/directory
```

To create packages for Windows and Linux separately, do this
```
grunt dist-linux64 #Linux 64-bit
grunt dist-linux32
grunt dist-win
```

To create all release builds at once, do this
```
grunt distAll
```
Packages are created in the appropriate `dist` folder

Note: Windows file names have a 260 char limit. The nested dependencies of node_modules can [cause issues while packaging](https://github.com/mllrsohn/node-webkit-builder/issues/107) the Windows release build. To avoid a nw:blank app, install `flatten-packages` (`npm install -g flatten-packages`) and run it on the app directory
```
flatten-packages app/
```
